I'm pretty fond of things that run fast and anything that looks dated on purpose.

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
* Getting my CompSci degree.

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
* Go, C, React and general web development.

#### ⚡ Fun facts:
* Big time anime/metal enthusiast;
* Hoping to get at least 10% of my ideas into the real world.

I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) by the way. 🤓
